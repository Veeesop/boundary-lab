# Boundary Lab

<img src="assets/mainwindow.png" alt="Boundary Lab main window" width="700">

Boundary Lab is a GUI-based multiphysics acoustic simulation tool for loudspeaker design. It generates or imports loudspeaker meshes, infers exterior BEM, interior FEM, or coupled FEM-BEM-LEM solving from a configured physical system, and presents acoustic and electroacoustic results in a desktop application. Ath is bundled as a geometry-generator provider with permission from Marcel Batik.

### [Follow the official development thread on DIYAudio](https://www.diyaudio.com/community/threads/boundary-lab.440847/)

## Features

- Waveguide design editor with one-click geometry generation through the bundled [Ath4](https://at-horns.eu/) generator
- 3D mesh viewport for generated geometry and imported `.msh` files
- Physical-system editor for exterior BEM, interior FEM, and coupled FEM-BEM-LEM models
- Prescribed-velocity and linear electrodynamic transducer components
- Channel controls for level, polarity, delay, and HPF/LPF crossover shaping
- Live horizontal/vertical directivity, on-axis response, spinorama, excursion, maximum-SPL, and impedance plots
- Plot-image, polar-data, on-axis channel-data, and balloon-data export
- 3D balloon viewer built directly from Fibonacci-sphere solve samples
- Project save/load with readable, backward-compatible `.blab.json` files

While not required, if modeling in Autodesk Fusion, the [Fusion2Msh](https://github.com/JWSound/fusiontomsh) add-in is strongly recommended for quick imports of mesh files into Boundary Lab.

## Windows quick start

1. Download a stable source archive from [Releases](https://github.com/JWSound/boundary-lab/releases/latest), extract it, and double-click `01_install_update_boundary-lab.bat`.
   For an older Git installation, first replace the updater with the `.bat` asset from the latest release; older copies still pull `main`.
2. Follow the guided prompts. The installer creates the Python environment and
   installs the BEAT Engine solver and can optionally prepare its Julia
   CPU, NVIDIA CUDA, and AMD ROCm environments.
3. If the installer adds Git, Python, or Julia, close it and run it again when
   instructed so Windows can refresh the available commands.
4. Double-click `02_start_boundary_lab.bat` to launch Boundary Lab.

## Apple Silicon source setup

Boundary Lab can run BEAT Engine Metal from source on Apple Silicon. See the
[macOS installation steps](docs/Installation%20and%20Setup.md#macos-apple-silicon)
for Python and Julia setup, Metal verification, backend selection, and the
qualified exterior and coupled solve examples. Preferences continue to default
to BEAT CPU; select BEAT Metal explicitly when you want to use it.

Ath geometry generation on macOS runs through Wine. You can instead import a
Gmsh mesh, including one exported with Fusion2Msh; details are in the
[installation guide](docs/Installation%20and%20Setup.md#ath-geometry-generation-on-macos).


## Solver Requirements

Boundary Lab uses BEAT Engine for numerical solving of exterior, interior, or coupled systems. BEAT Engine is an open-source acoustic solver platform written in Julia that is downloaded automatically as a pinned package as part of Boundary Lab. See [BEAT dependency setup](docs/advanced/BEAT%20Local%20Dependency.md) for updates and contributor overrides.

### BEAT Engine CUDA GPU Solver Requirements

* NVIDIA Maxwell-generation or newer GPU
* Latest NVIDIA Studio/Game Ready driver recommended
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/manual-downloads/) installed and available on `PATH`

To prepare the Julia environment, from the repository root run:

```bash
python -m beat_engine instantiate --backend cuda
```

### BEAT Engine ROCm GPU Solver Requirements

* AMD GPU supported by the installed ROCm/HIP SDK and operating system; check AMD's [Windows support matrix](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/radeon-ryzen/en/latest/docs/shared/hipsdk/reference/system-requirements.html) or [Linux compatibility matrix](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/compatibility/compatibility-matrix.html)
* Compatible AMD GPU driver and ROCm installation (HIP SDK on Windows), including rocBLAS and rocSOLVER
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/manual-downloads/) installed and available on `PATH`

To prepare the Julia environment, from the repository root with Boundary Lab's Python environment activated, run:

```bash
python -m beat_engine instantiate --backend rocm
```

The Windows installer can detect an existing AMD SDK and prepare the ROCm environment. See [BEAT Engine AMD ROCm setup](docs/advanced/beat-engine-rocm.md) for SDK configuration and runtime verification.

### BEAT Engine CPU Solver Requirements

* Intel, AMD, or ARM CPU
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/manual-downloads/) installed and available on `PATH`

To prepare the Julia environment, from the repository root run:

```bash
python -m beat_engine instantiate --backend cpu
```

GPU solving VRAM requirements scale quadratically with mesh element count for exterior BEM solving. Below are estimated VRAM requirements for various element counts:

| Total BEM Elements | Estimated VRAM |
|---:|---:|
| 1,000 | ~2 MB |
| 2,000 | ~8 MB |
| 3,000 | ~18 MB |
| 5,000 | ~50 MB |
| 7,000 | ~98 MB |
| 10,000 | ~200 MB |
| 15,000 | ~450 MB |
| 20,000 | ~800 MB |


## Application Installation

From the repository root run:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[gui]"
```

## Run The GUI

```bash
blab gui
```

## Boundary Lab Deploy

[Boundary Lab Deploy](https://github.com/JWSound/boundary_lab_deploy) is the
standalone deployment application. It consumes `.blabsp` speaker packages exported
by Boundary Lab and depends directly on BEAT Engine. New Deploy development and
installer releases belong in that repository. Speaker-package export remains in
Boundary Lab; neither application requires the other to be installed.

## Development

Create scoped branches and pull requests targeting `main`. Stable users should
install a [published release](https://github.com/JWSound/boundary-lab/releases/latest).
See [development and releases](docs/development.md) for setup, engine upgrades and
release qualification. The permanent `dev` branch is retired after reconciliation.
