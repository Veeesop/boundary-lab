# BEAT Engine dependency

Boundary Lab requires the independently released `beat-engine` package. Its
`pyproject.toml` pins the `v0.4.0rc1` wheel URL and SHA-256, so ordinary installation
downloads and verifies that exact artifact without a sibling engine checkout:

```text
python -m pip install -e ".[gui,dev]"
python -m beat_engine instantiate --backend cpu
python -m beat_engine doctor --backend cpu --threads 2
python -m beat_engine paths --backend cpu
```

Julia is installed separately; the wheel does not provide Julia or GPU drivers.
Use `--backend cpu`, `cuda`, `rocm`, or `metal` to prepare the corresponding
environment. Metal is available only on Apple Silicon macOS. Hardware
availability is a separate qualification from successful installation; inspect
`python -m beat_engine doctor --backend metal --threads 2` before selecting it.

Run these commands with Boundary Lab's Python environment activated. On Windows,
you can instead use `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe` in place of `python`. Installing
BEAT into another Python environment does not configure Boundary Lab's environment.

## Solver choices

The Preferences solver list comes from the installed engine's `backend_catalog()`
API, with Boundary Lab Server added by the application. Listing and selecting a
backend does not launch Julia, test hardware, install packages or contact GitHub.
There are no availability indicators in Preferences. A selected backend that
cannot run reports its name and the runtime error after Solve is clicked.

The same catalog supplies local backend IDs and Julia project paths to source
solves, physical-system solves, retained-field evaluation, and explicit CLI
backend choices. Legacy settings aliases are preserved. Unknown IDs fail instead
of selecting a different backend. Headless automatic selection retains its
CUDA-then-CPU policy.

## Updating an existing installation

Update the Boundary Lab checkout, then rerun its installer or the normal
`python -m pip install -e ".[gui]"` command. Boundary Lab selects its supported
engine release automatically. After an engine update, prepare each backend you
use again with `python -m beat_engine instantiate --backend cpu` (or `cuda`/`rocm`),
then inspect `doctor` output. The Windows installer's solver prompts perform
environment preparation and include CUDA/ROCm runtime checks.

The wheel supplies Julia source and project files, but not the downloaded Julia
packages. Previous Julia package downloads may be reused from the local depot;
the installed release's own project still needs to be instantiated. Restart
Boundary Lab after updating so existing workers do not retain the old engine.

The pinned release is
[v0.4.0rc1](https://github.com/Veeesop/BEAT_Engine/releases/tag/v0.4.0rc1).
It contains wheel and source distributions. No PyPI publication is configured.
This prerelease adds the Metal worker catalog entry; Boundary Lab has manually
qualified one exterior BEM fixture and one coupled FEM-BEM example on Apple
Silicon. See [macOS installation](../Installation%20and%20Setup.md#macos-apple-silicon)
for the exact test scope and source workflow.
The compiled-system contract, worker negotiation, transport, numerical sources,
and fixtures belong to BEAT Engine. Boundary Lab owns project compilation,
backend/SDK selection policy, GUI/CLI integration, and result models.

There is no bundled engine or distribution switch. Missing or incompatible engine
packages fail instead of falling back. `BLAB_BEAT_ENGINE_DISTRIBUTION` is obsolete
and can be removed from shell configuration.

## Contributor override

Install Boundary Lab normally first, then explicitly replace the engine in that
development environment:

```text
python -m pip install --no-deps -e <path-to-BEAT_Engine>
python -m beat_engine paths
```

Use a unique candidate version and preserve supported contracts. On the application
feature branch, update the dependency pin, supported-version check and associated
test expectations to that candidate version. Never relabel candidate code as an
existing stable version.
Reinstalling Boundary Lab may restore the pinned release; use a separate virtual
environment for engine development. To restore the release explicitly:

```text
python -m pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps "beat-engine @ https://github.com/Veeesop/BEAT_Engine/releases/download/v0.4.0rc1/beat_engine-0.4.0rc1-py3-none-any.whl#sha256=8bba352f925a709fe9aa8546c50dc1f173cf6f2b5b9ea479300cf0c9fb25b267"
```

Rerunning the regular editable Boundary Lab install also restores its declared
engine pin.

## Updating the engine

Qualify the new engine version independently, then update Boundary Lab's dependency
URL/hash and supported-version check together. Run application tests and
`python scripts/check_engine_integration.py`; compare complex result arrays with
the prior release and check engine/runtime provenance. Package installation must
work without an editable engine checkout. GPU changes also require matching
hardware qualification.
