# Installation and Setup

This guide covers installing, updating, and preparing Boundary Lab on Windows,
Linux, and Apple Silicon macOS. Only the Python application and GUI are required
to design systems, import meshes, and inspect projects. Geometry generation
through Ath and each solver backend have their own runtime requirements described
below.

Boundary Lab requires Python 3.11 or newer.

The guided Windows scripts target 64-bit Windows 10 and 11. The Linux commands
below target an x86-64 Debian or Ubuntu desktop, including Ubuntu under WSL2.
The Python application and BEAT Engine CPU backend may work on other Linux
architectures, but the bundled Windows Ath executable requires an
x86-compatible Wine environment.

## Windows

### Guided installation

Download and extract the latest stable source archive from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/JWSound/boundary-lab/releases/latest).
The Windows path uses the two batch files in that release:

1. Double-click `01_install_update_boundary-lab.bat`.
2. Allow the script to install Git or Python if either prerequisite is missing.
   Close the window and run the script again when instructed so Windows can
   refresh the available commands.
3. Choose whether to prepare the optional Julia-based BEAT Engine solvers. If
   an NVIDIA GPU is detected, the installer also offers to prepare and verify
   the CUDA environment.
4. Double-click `02_start_boundary_lab.bat` to launch the application.

The installer creates `.venv`, installs or repairs Boundary Lab and its GUI
dependencies, and validates the `blab` command. When run from an existing Git
checkout, it can optionally select the latest published stable release tag in a
detached checkout. Source archives have no Git metadata and must be updated by
downloading another stable archive.

For development, use scoped branches from `main` and decline the stable update
prompt. The permanent `dev` branch is retired; see [development](development.md).
Installation and repair then use the current checkout.

Installing Boundary Lab also downloads its pinned BEAT Engine wheel from GitHub
and verifies the declared SHA-256. No separate BEAT checkout or manual wheel
download is needed. The optional solver prompts prepare Julia dependencies;
they do not control whether the BEAT Python package is installed.

The installer discovers numerical asset paths inside `.venv` through BEAT's
`engine_paths()` API. Old commands pointing into `src/blab/solvers/julia_local`,
`julia_cuda`, or `julia_rocm` no longer apply. See
[BEAT dependency setup](advanced/BEAT%20Local%20Dependency.md) for manual updates.

The launcher remembers an NVIDIA GPU selection when more than one is
available. To select again, run this from Command Prompt in the repository:

```bat
02_start_boundary_lab.bat /choose
```

### Manual Windows installation

Install Python 3.11 or newer and Git, then run the following from the repository
folder in PowerShell:

```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[gui]"
blab gui
```

If PowerShell prevents activation of local scripts, the environment can be
used without activation:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e ".[gui]"
.\.venv\Scripts\blab.exe gui
```

Ath runs natively on Windows, and Boundary Lab meshes its geometry through the
cross-platform Python Gmsh library. Wine is not required.

## macOS Apple Silicon

The source workflow is qualified on Apple Silicon with macOS 26.6.2, Python
3.11.16, and Julia 1.12.7. Use Python 3.11 or newer and Julia 1.12; Metal
requires an Apple GPU and is available only on macOS. This does not provide a
packaged or signed macOS application.

Install Git, Python, and [Julia 1.12](https://julialang.org/downloads/), then
clone the Boundary Lab repository and create its environment from the checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Veeesop/boundary-lab.git
cd boundary-lab
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[gui]"
```

The installation fetches the hash-pinned BEAT Engine 0.4.0rc1 wheel. Prepare
the Metal Julia project and check the actual worker/device status:

```bash
julia --version
python -m beat_engine instantiate --backend metal
python -m beat_engine doctor --backend metal --threads 2
python -m beat_engine paths --backend metal
```

In the doctor JSON, confirm `engine.version` is `0.4.0rc1` and
`backends.metal.available` is `true`. A successful command exit by itself is not
proof that a Metal device is available. Metal qualification has exercised an
exterior BEM case and a coupled FEM-BEM case on an M5 Max; it does not establish
accuracy or support for every project, mesh, frequency, or symmetry setting.

Launch the GUI and select the backend explicitly in **Preferences → Solver**:

```bash
blab gui
```

BEAT CPU remains the default and is always available for explicit selection.
Selecting Metal is saved and used as requested. If Metal cannot start or the worker reports a
device/library error, Boundary Lab surfaces that error and does not silently
switch to CPU or another accelerator. Select BEAT CPU explicitly to run on the
CPU.

The recorded source qualification used BEAT 0.4.0rc1 on an Apple M5 Max
(40-core GPU, Metal 4), macOS 26.6.2, Python 3.11.16, and Julia 1.12.7. The
exterior case was `tests/fixtures/remote-exterior.blab.json`, 500 Hz, symmetry
off, with mesh SHA-256
`05a598280322384155bc0a6b99282280a6661e6cdc84b58f30065599d97963ed`. The
coupled case was `examples/SKRAM/SKRAM.blab.json`, 80 Hz, X symmetry, with the
project and mesh identities recorded in each run manifest. Both explicit Metal
solves completed with finite complex results and `beat_metal` provenance.
Matching explicit CPU solves also completed. These single-frequency checks
record backend integration and do not define a numerical parity tolerance or a
general accuracy claim.

### Ath geometry generation on macOS

Boundary Lab invokes its bundled `ath.exe` through `wine` on macOS; Ath is not a
native macOS application. Install and configure a Wine build that can run the
bundled executable, make `wine` available on the `PATH` used to launch Boundary
Lab, and verify it with:

```bash
wine --version
```

If Wine or Ath is unavailable, import a mesh generated by another tool. Boundary
Lab reads Gmsh `.msh` files; Fusion users can export from Autodesk Fusion with
the [Fusion2Msh add-in](https://github.com/JWSound/fusiontomsh) on a supported
Fusion host and then transfer the mesh to the Mac.

## Linux

The examples below use Debian or Ubuntu package names. Adapt them for the
package manager used by another distribution.

### Application and GUI

Install the base tools and Qt/X11 runtime libraries:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install \
  git python3 python3-pip python3-venv \
  libegl1 libgl1 \
  libxcb-cursor0 libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-keysyms1 \
  libxcb-xkb1 libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

Clone and install Boundary Lab:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JWSound/boundary-lab.git
cd boundary-lab
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[gui]"
blab gui
```

### WSLg and Wayland

The embedded VTK mesh preview currently requires Qt and VTK to use compatible
window handles. If startup under WSLg or a Wayland session fails with an X11
`BadWindow` or `X_ConfigureWindow` error, launch Boundary Lab through Qt's xcb
backend:

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb blab gui
```

The xcb libraries in the Linux prerequisite command are required for this
backend. Avoid setting `QT_QPA_PLATFORM` globally because it would affect every
Qt application in the shell environment.

## Ath geometry generation on Linux

Boundary Lab automatically invokes the bundled `ath.exe` through `wine` on
Linux. The bundled Ath executable is 32-bit; Gmsh runs natively through the
Python package installed with Boundary Lab.

On Debian or Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --install-recommends wine wine64 wine32:i386
```

Wine's default 64-bit/WoW64 prefix supports Ath. An optional dedicated prefix
can be initialized with:

```bash
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine-boundary-lab"
wineboot -u
```

Launch Boundary Lab from a shell carrying the same `WINEPREFIX`. No .NET
runtime, Wine Mono, Wine Gecko, or Winetricks package is required for Ath mesh
generation. Gnuplot is optional and is not used by Boundary Lab's normal mesh
generation workflow.

Generated Ath GEO, diagnostic logs, and final solve-ready meshes are written
below `runs/generated_geometry`. Gmsh meshing runs in a cancellable child
process, and no intermediate raw mesh is written or reloaded.

## Solver setup

Boundary Lab offers four local BEAT Engine backends. The CPU, CUDA, and ROCm
backends support exterior BEM and coupled FEM-BEM systems, including X and XY
symmetry. Metal qualification scope is stated in the table below.

| Backend | Hardware/runtime | Exterior BEM | Coupled FEM-BEM |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|
| BEAT Engine CPU | Julia and CPU BLAS/LAPACK | Yes | Yes |
| BEAT Engine Nvidia CUDA | Julia and supported NVIDIA GPU | Yes | Yes |
| BEAT Engine AMD ROCm | Julia, AMDGPU.jl, and a functional ROCm SDK | Yes | Yes |
| BEAT Engine Apple Metal | Apple Silicon GPU and macOS | Yes* | Yes* |

*Metal was exercised on an M5 Max for the 500 Hz exterior fixture and the 80 Hz
coupled SKRAM example documented above. Other models, frequencies, symmetry
modes, and interior-only solving are not covered by this Boundary Lab hardware
qualification. The installed BEAT catalog advertises Metal support for exterior,
interior, and coupled solve kinds; the interior solve kind has not been
qualified here.*

To run a one-frequency check on an existing project, create a request overlay
such as `metal-check.json` in the repository root:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "frequencies_hz": [80.0],
  "include_project_observations": false,
  "probes": [
    {
      "id": "on_axis",
      "coordinate_frame": "project",
      "points_m": [[0.0, 0.0, 2.0]]
    }
  ]
}
```

Validate first, then solve explicitly with Metal and a new output directory:

```bash
blab project validate examples/SKRAM/SKRAM.blab.json \
  --backend beat_metal --request metal-check.json --json
blab project solve examples/SKRAM/SKRAM.blab.json \
  --backend beat_metal --request metal-check.json \
  --julia-threads 2 --output runs/metal-skram-check
```

For an exterior-only check, use an exterior BEM project and set a suitable
representative frequency in the request overlay. `beat_auto` intentionally
remains CUDA-then-CPU; select `beat_metal` explicitly for a Metal run. Result
manifests record backend, engine version, mesh hashes, and completed frequencies;
complex output arrays are stored per frequency under `frequencies/`.

Bempp and the legacy HTTP solve server are retired. Saved backend selections
for either migrate to BEAT CPU. The ROCm path uses GPU-resident regular and Duffy singular operator
assembly, rocBLAS/rocSOLVER dense solves, and GPU exterior field evaluation.
See [BEAT Engine AMD ROCm](advanced/beat-engine-rocm.md) for setup and
validation details.

### BEAT Engine AMD ROCm on Windows

Install an AMD Windows HIP SDK supported by your GPU using AMD's
[Windows HIP SDK installer](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-windows/en/latest/).
AMD publishes the current GPU and operating-system matrix in the
[Windows system requirements](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/radeon-ryzen/en/latest/docs/shared/hipsdk/reference/system-requirements.html).
Restart the terminal after installation so updated environment variables are visible.

Run `01_install_update_boundary-lab.bat` and accept the ROCm solver prompt. The
installer detects `HIP_PATH`, `ROCM_PATH`, `ROCM_HOME`, and installed SDK versions
under `%ProgramFiles%\AMD\ROCm`; it then prepares the Julia environment and verifies
AMDGPU.jl, rocBLAS, and rocSOLVER. Boundary Lab deliberately does not download or
silently elevate AMD's SDK installer because it requires separate license acceptance.

Portable TheRock SDK layouts can be selected during installation or configured later:

```powershell
blab rocm configure "$env:USERPROFILE\SDKs\ROCm-TheRock"
blab rocm detect --json
```

This stores a per-user path under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Boundary Lab`, avoiding a
checkout-specific drive or directory. Use `blab rocm clear` to remove the saved
override.

### BEAT Engine CPU

Install [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and make `julia` available on
`PATH`. After installing Boundary Lab, activate its Python environment and prepare
the installed CPU project:

```bash
python -m beat_engine instantiate --backend cpu
python -m beat_engine doctor --backend cpu --threads 2
```

The CPU backend supports Intel, AMD, and ARM processors. Runtime depends heavily
on the mesh size, frequency range, symmetry, and the BLAS implementation used by
Julia.

### BEAT Engine CUDA

Install a current NVIDIA driver for a Maxwell-generation or newer NVIDIA GPU,
then install Julia and prepare the CUDA project:

```bash
python -m beat_engine instantiate --backend cuda
python -m beat_engine doctor --backend cuda --threads 2
```

Inspect the doctor's `backends.cuda.available` field and any reported reason.
The doctor prints capability information; a successful process exit alone does
not establish that CUDA is available.

On WSL2, use an NVIDIA Windows driver with WSL CUDA support. Do not install a
second Linux display driver inside WSL.

GPU solve memory grows approximately quadratically with the number of mesh
elements. The following values are planning estimates rather than hard limits:

| Total elements | Estimated VRAM |
|---:|---:|
| 1,000 | ~50-100 MB |
| 2,000 | ~200-300 MB |
| 3,000 | ~400-600 MB |
| 5,000 | ~1.0-1.5 GB |
| 7,000 | ~2.0-3.0 GB |
| 10,000 | ~4-6 GB |
| 15,000 | ~8-12 GB |
| 20,000 | ~14-20 GB |

## Updating an installation

For installations from 0.4.3 or older, first replace the updater with the `.bat`
asset from the latest stable release. Old updater copies still pull main.
Then run `01_install_update_boundary-lab.bat` and accept the stable update prompt.
Automatic updates require clean tracked files, no unpublished commits, and either
main or a detached release tag. Feature branches must be managed manually.

For manual Windows or Linux installations, select the published stable tag from
the Releases page (replace `vX.Y.Z` with that exact tag):

```bash
git fetch origin tag vX.Y.Z
git switch --detach vX.Y.Z
python -m pip install -e ".[gui]"
```

Rerun the applicable Julia `Pkg.instantiate()` command after solver dependency
changes.

## Installation diagnostics

Useful checks from an activated environment are:

```bash
python --version
python -m pip check
blab --help
```

If Ath reports that Wine is required, confirm that `wine` is available on the
same `PATH` used to launch Boundary Lab:

```bash
wine --version
```
